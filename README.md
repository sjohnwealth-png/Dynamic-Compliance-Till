# Dynamic Compliance Till

A human‑centred, regulator-focused age verification feature for licensed premises.

This project removes the single biggest failure point in age checks: staff doing mental arithmetic under pressure. It provides a clear, always-on cutoff date and a fast, reliable age calculator for absolute certainty at the point of sale.

## The problem
- Bar staff are under time pressure and must often perform arithmetic to decide if an ID holder is 18+. This leads to slow service, high stress and a real risk of wrong decisions that can cost licences and fines.

## The solution
Two simple components work together to eliminate guesswork:

1. Dynamic Compliance Panel — permanently visible on the till. Shows the exact cutoff birth date ("MUST BE BORN ON OR BEFORE") updated from the device clock and refreshed in real time.
2. Instant Verification Modal — tap the panel, enter D/M/Y from the ID and the system instantly shows age and a clear APPROVED / REFUSED verdict.

Open the demo: `bar_till_system.html` (proof of concept).

## Why this matters to UK regulators (RASG)
- Removes human arithmetic errors and reduces enforcement risk.
- Speeds service and preserves business revenue while protecting public safety.
- Creates a clear, auditable interaction that supports licence compliance.

## Benefits
- Fast: verification in seconds, minimal impact on queue flow.
- Confident: a simple, unambiguous pass/fail display for staff.
- Defensible: reduces human error and helps demonstrate due diligence.

## Pilot and next steps
We welcome a regulator-led pilot or evaluation. Suggestions:
- Small event trial (1–3 tills) with RASG observers.
- Logging or CSV export for shift reporting and audits.
- Integration options with POS or payment terminals.
